## 📂 Dataset Details

- Records: ~48,000 entries  
- Key attributes:
  - Content Type
  - Language
  - Genre
  - Rating
  - Duration
  - Episode Count
  - Season Count  

The dataset represents a mix of movies, series, sports, and teaser content.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Content availability is highly imbalanced across languages and genres.
- Some languages dominate in volume, while others show higher average ratings.
- A small number of genres contribute a large percentage of the total content.
- Percentage-based visualizations help reveal patterns hidden by raw counts.
